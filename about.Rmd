##Project

futureNow is a website application that predicts the volume of people around a certain area. The predictions are based on factors such as weather, public transport usage, traffic volume and pedestrian counts.

Our team members often make decisions on their mode of transport to work/school based on the weather and traffic congestion. The weather can influence traffic conditions such as speed and accidents. It also effects trains with delays or cancellations. Understanding where large crowds appear from Internet of Thing and smart sensors help inform us of making better travel arrangements.

#### End Users / Target Audience

Our main users would be Commuters and Government Agencies. Commuters can look into the app and get a rough picture of how crowded their destination or route will be. They can then decide if they would like to drive or use public transportation. Government Agencies, on the other hand, can anticipate and plan for extra services or add additional lane ways.

Other potential users include the Police Force, Ambulances and Public Transport Victoria (PTV). The Police can estimate traffic volume and enforcement. Ambulances can predict the volume of patronage within an area and choose the best route to take. PTV can predict the number of commuters and decide if they would like to use an extra train/tram to accommodate the number of passengers.

**Scenarios:**

1. John is a 28 year old who has had a very bad day and wishes to travel home after a long and tiring day, he gets onto the website, puts in all the necessary information, and can immediately see the trains will be overcrowded. He realizes that itâs going to be too crowded, so he decides to hail a taxi/uber instead of the train.

2. Anna drives the ambulance and responds to emergency calls. She needs to be informed about congested areas and determine the quickest route to the hospital. Before her shift starts, she checks our website on her phone and can immediately tell which areas have a low probability of congestion throughout the day.

3. Andrew works at PTV and is in charge of ensuring train efficiency. Our website helps inform him that Glenferrie Station will be very crowded today. He decides to deploy extra services on the Belgrave, Lilydale or Alamein lines to accommodate the volume of commuters.

#### Limitations
1. Data Availability & Granularity.
